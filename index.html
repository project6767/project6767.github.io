		<p>In <i>Born a Crime</i>, Trevor Noah shares a tale of his youth growing up in South Africa during apartheid.
			A time with rigid laws and extreme social division that disputed his mere existence.
			Because he had a black mother and a white father, his identity itself was illegal, forcing him to navigate a world with no space for him.
			As Noah stated, <a href="https://pursuitofdiversity.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/born-a-crime-trevor-noah.pdf">“I was born a crime”</a>, a statement that captured how the system he was born into shaped the way he understood his own identity.
			These experiences early in his childhood created a different groundwork that changed his perspective and humor that would later define his future career.</p>

		<p>After publishing <i>Born a Crime</i>, Trevor's voice reached global audiences.
			He then joined <i>The Daily Show</i> in 2015, taking over from the former host, Jon Stewart.
			The transition was nothing close to easy, with Stewart being adored by many.
			The criticism from the viewers led to the show's rating dropping by over 37% around its 100th episode.
			Despite this skepticism from the viewers, Noah and with the help of the team, pushed through and found his foundation.
			Noah figured out how he was going to find his way through the pressure of the global platform by blending his humor and his social commentary.
			Noah would continue to host the show till 2022. The spotlight led to his eventual burnout, leaving no time for friends, family, and personal growth.
			Departing was the only way for him to find his real passion. Since leaving the spotlight, Noah has continued to diversify his career.
			He has hosted the Grammys every year since 2021 and launched an interview style called What Now? And has been touring around the world doing stand-up comedy.</p>

		<p>Even with all these accolades, he's struggled. Trevor is extremely self-conscious, often reflecting on himself, even going out of his way to be single and emotionally aware of himself.
			Since leaving, he has tried to balance the emotional weight of his past, which sparked an idea to help young men with emotional connections programs.
			Going through it himself, he goes out of his way to help young men with anger, isolation, and emotional openness.
			He's also opened doors to help children with mental health and ADHD, which he also struggled with.
			Trevor describes ADHD and mental problems as having a “zoom lens” analogy to describe the loss of life's intention and the absorption of the wrong things in life.
			He also has outreach programs supporting youth education and, via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dayzeroproductions/?hl=en">Day Zero Production</a>,
			which helps to bring diverse voices to television—describing all this in the interview below.</p>
