		<h2>Trevor Noah, Author of <i>Born a Crime</i>. Photograph from 2024.</h2>
		
		<p>In <i>Born a Crime</i>, Trevor Noah shares a tale of his youth growing up in South Africa during apartheid.
			A time with rigid laws and extreme social division that disputed his mere existence.
			Because he had a black mother and a white father, his identity itself was illegal, forcing him to navigate a world with no space for him.
			As Noah stated, <a href="https://pursuitofdiversity.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/born-a-crime-trevor-noah.pdf">“I was born a crime”</a>, a statement that captured how the system he was born into shaped the way he understood his own identity.
			These experiences early in his childhood created a different groundwork that changed his perspective and humor that would later define his future career.</p>

		<p>After publishing <i>Born a Crime</i>, Trevor's voice reached global audiences.
			He then joined <i><a href="https://share.google/BdzncRn7PYrnhjUGw">The Daily Show</a></i> in 2015, taking over from the former host, Jon Stewart.
			The transition was nothing close to easy, with Stewart being adored by many.
			The criticism from the viewers led to the show's rating dropping by over 37% around its 100th episode.
			Despite this skepticism from the viewers, Noah and with the help of the team, pushed through and found his foundation.
			Noah figured out how he was going to find his way through the pressure of the global platform by blending his humor and his social commentary.
			Noah would continue to host the show till 2022. The spotlight led to his eventual burnout, leaving no time for friends, family, and personal growth.
			Departing was the only way for him to find his real passion. Since leaving the spotlight, Noah has continued to diversify his career.
			He has hosted the Grammys every year since 2021, launched an interview style called What Now? With Trevor Noah, and has been touring around the world doing stand-up comedy.</p>

		<h2>Trevor Noah hosting the 2024 Grammys</h2>
		
		<p>Even with all these accolades, he's had his share of personal struggles. Since the publishing of Born A Crime Trevor was diagnosed with ADHD, which he has cited as a cause of the depression that he also dealt with.
			In an interview, he described his struggle with depression with the analogy of a zoom lens.
			When his ADHD causes him to zoom too far in on life and the world around him, he struggles to focus on what he needs to do, and what he’s working for in life.
			If his ADHD zooms his attention too far out, it can lead to depression about the apparent meaninglessness of life. His own struggles with ADHD have made him a strong advocate for ADHD awareness.
			Trevor Noah has also founded the <a href="https://trevornoahfoundation.org">Trevor Noah Foundation</a>,
			which works to improve the quality of schools in South Africa, and to make education more accessible to South African children of all races.</p>
